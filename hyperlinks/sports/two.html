    <h1>Obiena to donate incentive to de Vega</h1>

      <p>
        (UPDATES) OLYMPIAN Ernest John "EJ" Obiena pledged to donate the P250,000 cash incentive he is set to receive from the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) to the ailing track legend Lydia de Vega, who was once considered as the fastest woman in Asia but is now slowed down by a Stage 4 breast cancer.
      </p>
  <p>
    Obiena, 26, is bound to receive the said amount from the government after setting a new Asian record of 5.94 meters in the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, USA, where he also became the first Filipino to win a medal in the annual event last Monday.

"I have just learned of the plans of PSC to reward me with a 250,000 pesos incentive for breaking the Asian record. This is deeply appreciated, and certainly needed since my funding is still yet to be sorted, despite the mediation agreement," wrote Obiena in a Facebook post on Friday.

              <p>
                "However, on the flight back to Italy, it occurred to me that despite my own training needs, Mam Lydia needs this money more than I do. So, I am hereby pledging to give these 250,000 pesos once paid, directly to the family of Lydia de Vega for her medical expenses."
              </p>
              <p>
                De Vega, a 9-time Southeast Asian Games gold medalist, a 2-time Asian Games gold medalist, and a 4-time Asian Athletics Championship winner, was the country's leading participant in the first-ever World Athletics Championships in 1983.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obiena said he is "deeply saddened by the news of Mam Lydia's health issues, and the pleas of her family for financial assistance for the mounting medical bills."
              </p>
              <p>
                And this is the reason why he is not the only one who's donating a significant amount of money to de Vega. After a discussion with his team, he also had his advisor James Lafferty and nutritionist Carol Lafferty donating P250,000 as well. That will raise the total of Team Obiena's donation to de Vega to P500,000.
