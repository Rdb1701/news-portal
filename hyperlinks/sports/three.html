    <h1>Finau rides momentum to earn a share of lead</h1>

          LOS ANGELES: Tony Finau, fresh off his third US PGA Tour triumph, fired eight birdies in a near-flawless eight-under-par 64 on Thursday (Friday in Manila) to share the Rocket Mortgage Classic lead with Taylor Pendrith.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was riding the high off of last week," said Finau, who pulled away late on Sunday (Monday) to win the 3M Open in Minnesota by three strokes.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Detroit Golf Club, Finau hit all but one fairway and — for the first time in his career — all 18 greens in regulation.

                He picked up three more birdies coming in, flying a four-iron frm 250 yards to 42 feet for a two-putt birdie at the par-five seventh then draining a 41-foot birdie putt at the eighth.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I had to get all of it to get it to the hole and hit it right in the middle of the green and was able to two-putt that to kind of keep the momentum up on a solid round," Finau said of his impressive birdie at the seventh.
              </p>
              <p>
                He had a 20-foot birdie attempt at his final hole for a course record — but couldn't get it to drop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pendrith, a rookie from Canada who was sidelined after the Players Championship in March with a broken rib then had to pull out of the John Deere Classic after testing positive for Covid, had nine birdies with one bogey in his eight-under effort.

"When I'm healthy, I can compete with the best," Pendrith said. "Other than the injury, it's been a great rookie year so far and just nice to be back."

Pendrith also opened with a birdie at the 10th, and added three more before his one bogey at the 18th, where he was in a fairway bunker off the tee.

He added five birdies coming in, including a 24-footer at the fifth.
