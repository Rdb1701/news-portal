    <h1>UK to host Eurovision Song Contest 2023</h1>

        The European Broadcasting Union has confirmed that the United Kingdom and the British Broadcasting Corporation will have the right to host the 67th edition of the contest in 2023.
      </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            In an announcement on its website, the United Kingdom will be stepping in on behalf of Ukraine, who, despite winning this year's contest, could not be able to host the next contest.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the BBC have confirmed that the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest will be hosted in the United Kingdom on behalf of this year's winning broadcaster, Ukraine's UA:PBC (National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine)," the Contest announced.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We're exceptionally grateful that the BBC has accepted to stage the Euro-vision Song Contest in the UK in 2023," stated the contest's executive supervi-sor Martin Österdahl.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being this year's winner, Ukraine will be given an automatic place in next year's grand final. The EBU earlier said Ukraine could not host next year's show because of the ongoing war with neighboring Russia, which is why the decision was made to hold the show in the United Kingdom, which finished second this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ukraine, as the winning country in 2022, will automatically qualify for the Grand Final of the upcoming Contest along with the so-called 'Big 5'," the Contest's website wrote.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Big Five" are countries that financially contribute the most towards the Contest: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which is next year's host. Since 2004, then known as the "Big Four", these countries always have an automatic spot in the grand final and when Italy returned after a 14-year absence in 2011, it later was changed to the "Big Five". Despite having dismal results between 2005 and 2008, countries from the "Big Five" have al-ways reached the top 10 of every Contest since 2009. This year, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy (which was this year's host country) were in the top 10, finishing second, third, and sixth respectively.
